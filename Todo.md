# Todo

## Cutting Bits

Ideally we need some additional collets for larger drill bits
and some milling bits for horizontal milling

## Electronics

Currently there are no end stops

  * We need to design / make some brackets for the end stops
  * We need some inductive sensors
  * We need a PCB / Board to step the voltage down for the end stops

Also we may want an E-Stop button on the Enclosure
