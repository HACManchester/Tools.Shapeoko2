# Feed Rates

Mention Time taken and how the feedrate has an impact on it

also see if theres a limit on the depth of cut

defaults are based on the selected tool
normally when creating a new tool, the feedrate defaults to 1000mm/min and 333.3 mm/min but this is too fast


currently trying quater of default speed for adaptive clearing
and half for finishing passes
its better to set it in hsmworks to avoid rough stepping

Try to use bigger mill bits wherever possible to save time
